      "For this exercise, you will be coding your very first class, a Queue class. Queues are a fundamental computer science data structure. A queue is basically like a line at Disneyland - you can add elements to a queue, and they maintain a specific order. When you want to get something off the end of a queue, you get the item that has been in there the longest (this is known as 'first-in-first-out', or FIFO). You can read up on queues at Wikipedia if you'd like to learn more.\n",
      "In your Queue class, you will need three methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. __init__: initialize your Queue (think: how will you store the queue's elements? You'll need to initialize an appropriate object attribute in this method)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. insert: inserts one element in your Queue\n",
      "\n",
      "3. remove: removes (or 'pops') one element from your Queue and returns it. If the queue is empty, raises a ValueError.\n",
      "When you're done, you should test your implementation. Your results should look something like this:"
