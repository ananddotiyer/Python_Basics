      "1. What is the difference between an Algorithm and a Program?\n",
      "    a. An algorithm is a conceptual idea, a program is a concrete instantiation of an algorithm.\n",
      "    b. An algorithm is limited to mathematical operation, a program can specify all kinds of operations\n",
      "    c. An algorithm makes a slow program run fast\n",
      "    d. An algorithm deals with computer hardware, a program deals with computer software.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A computational mode of thinking means that everything can be viewed as a math problem involving numbers and formulas.\n",
      "    a. True\n",

      "    c. points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program\n",
      "    d. remembers how many times a program has been executed\n",
      "\n",
      "11. What does it mean when we say that \"the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation\"?\n",
      "    a. The computer tests each instruction to ensure it will not harm the circuitry\n",
      "    b. The computer executes the instructions in strict, linear sequence, just like walking in a straight line\n",
      "    c. The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence\n",
      "    d. The computer slowly executes instructions so that we can follow its progress, rather than running a program at full speed\n",
